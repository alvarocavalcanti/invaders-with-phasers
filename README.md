# Invaders... With Phasers!

Hi. This is a simple base project for a [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)-like game, created with [Phaser](http://phaser.io)

This code includes:

- The non-minified release of Phaser v2.1.3 "Ravinda"
- A basic index.html file with the scaffolding code, ready for your game logic
- A few art assets from the [Tyrian](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/04/free-game-graphics-tyrian-ships-and.html) game, by [DanC](http://lostgarden.com)

## How to get going

1. Clone this repo
1. Serve its folder using any webserver (I recommend [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server))
1. Hit http://localhost:8080/ and there you have it
